# TiniBot

### A Discord bot for the rest of us.

(name pending)

A Work in Progress Discord Bot with music, memery and miscellaneous functionality. This bot is in somewhat active development and hasn't reached a stable state just yet, so I'd not reccomend using it in your servers just yet, but hey, you do you.

## Commands

### Music

**!play**: Plays a music video searched on YouTube. You can also use a link! If the bot's already playing, the song will be automatically queued.

**!join**: Joins the voice call you're currently in.

**!volume**: Sets up the volume that the music will play in.

**!skip**: Votes to skip a song -- three votes are required to skip. The song requester can automatically skip.

**!volume**: Sets up the volume that the music will play in.

**!stop**: Clears the queue and leaves the voice channel.

**!playing**: Displays the song you're currently playing.

**!summon**: Summons the bot to join the current voice call you're in.

### Memery

*WIP*

### Misc

**!ping**: Returns a <<Pong!>> message. Pretty neat, huh?

**!say**: Say something -- the bot will say it back to you.

**!8ball**: Tini's also a fortune teller - ask something and she'll tell you the future!

**!commands**: Pops up a page somewhat similar to this. Sorta incomplete.

**!about**: You ever wanted to know everything about this bot? Here ya go, you silly doofus!
